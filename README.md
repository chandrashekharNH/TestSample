Performance
	•	Asynchronous Network Calls: The ViewModel fetches posts using asynchronous network calls (networkService.fetchPosts). This ensures the UI remains responsive, as network operations do not block the main thread. Performance is further enhanced if the network service implements caching, reducing the need for repeated requests for the same data.
	•	Lazy Loading in UITableView:  We can inherently supports lazy loading of cells. Cells are dequeued and loaded only as they become visible, which conserves memory and processing resources, especially in long lists with lot of data.


Readability
	•	Clear Separation of Concerns: The MVVM architecture separates the presentation logic from the UI code. The ViewModel (PostViewModel) handles data fetching and business logic, while the ViewController (PostsViewController) manages UI-related responsibilities. This separation makes the code easier to understand and follow.
	•	Descriptive Naming: The sample uses descriptive naming conventions that clearly indicate the purpose and functionality of each component (e.g., PostViewModel, fetchPosts). This enhances the readability and makes the codebase more approachable for new developers or when revisiting the code after some time.

Maintainability
	•	Modularity: By encapsulating the network logic within a distinct service (NetworkServiceProtocol) and adhering to a protocol, the app's components become more interchangeable and easier to update or replace. For example, switching to a different network library would require changes only within the network service implementation, not throughout the app.
	•	Decoupled Architecture: The ViewModel does not directly manipulate the view or depend on UIKit, making it easier to modify either the UI or business logic independently. This decoupling is crucial for maintaining a growing codebase.

Testability
	•	ViewModel Unit Testing: The PostViewModel can be easily tested in isolation from the UI. By injecting a mock network service that conforms to NetworkServiceProtocol, tests can verify the ViewModel's behavior under various conditions (e.g., successful data fetch, network failure) without making real network requests.

	•	Dependency Injection: The ViewModel's initializer accepts a networkService parameter, allowing for dependency injection. This is particularly useful for testing, as it enables the injection of mock services to simulate different scenarios.

Scalability
	•	Protocol-Oriented Network Service: The use of a protocol (NetworkServiceProtocol) for the network layer makes it easier to adapt the app as requirements evolve. For instance, if the app needs to support multiple data sources in the future, developers can implement additional services conforming to this protocol without changing the ViewModel or ViewController code.

	•	Extensible Architecture: The clear separation between the ViewModel, ViewController, and services supports the easy addition of new features. For example, adding new functionalities like post filtering or sorting would primarily involve updates to the ViewModel and potentially new UI controls in the ViewController, without the need for extensive refactoring.


Simplicity
	•	Focused Responsibilities: Each component of the app has a single, focused responsibility. The ViewModel handles data and state, the network service manages data fetching, and the ViewController deals with presenting the data. This focus contributes to a codebase that's easier to understand and work with.
